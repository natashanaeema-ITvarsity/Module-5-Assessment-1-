                <p class="intro">The Sun or Sol,is the star at the center of our solar system,responsible for the Earth's climate and weather</p>
                
                <p>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just diameter between the holes and equator.The average radius of the sun is (109.2 x that of the Earth) of which 20-25% is the core. </p>
                
                <p>If a hollow sun was filled up with spherical Earths then an average of 960,000 will fit inside.On the other side if these Earths were squished inside wasted space then around 1,300,00 would fit inside.The Sun's surface area is times than that of Earths  </p>
